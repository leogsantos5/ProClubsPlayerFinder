# ⚽ Pro Clubs Player Finder

> A full-stack web application for connecting **FIFA EAFC 24 Pro Clubs** players, club owners, and free agents — built with **Blazor WebAssembly** and **ASP.NET Core Web API on .NET 8**.

This was my first personal Blazor + .NET 8 project built entirely from scratch outside any online course. Fully responsive, real-world features, and inspired by EAFC 24's UI.
